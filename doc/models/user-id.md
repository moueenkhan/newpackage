# User ID

This group consists of all possible user identifier types. The 'epUserID' field is the VPL generated unique identifier for a User and is the equivalent of a Virtual Account Number (VAN). The 'merchantUserID' is a merchant specified identifier for the User. The 'epUserID', 'merchantUserID' or both 'epUserID' and 'merchantUserID' can be supplied. A mapping will be performed to retrieve the merchant user ID from the supplied EP user ID and vice versa. If both the 'epUserID' and 'merchantUserID' are supplied, a check will be performed to ensure that the two are mapped. If the two provided fields are not mapped, then a validation error code will be returned. At least one of the fields must be populated.
