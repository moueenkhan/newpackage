## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IsBankAccountValid` | `bool` | Required | Returns true if bank details have passed validation checks. In this case, the other response attributes of anticipatedPayoutRequestTime, serviceLevel and expectedSettlementDate are returned. |
| `AnticipatedPayoutRequestTime` | `string` | Optional | A valid ISO 8601 timestamp, such as YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssÂ±hh:mm. This is the timestamp when the payout is anticipated to be sent to Earthport. This matches the supplied anticipatedPayoutRequestTime request attribute but the value returned will be in UTC (zero offset) dateTime. Therefore, a value supplied as 2013-01-20T12:30:00-05:00 will be returned as the UTC equivalent of 2013-01-20T17:30:00+00:00. |
| `ServiceLevel` | [`Models.ServiceLevelEnum?`](../../doc/models/service-level-enum.md) | Optional | Supported service levels for a payout request (standard or express). |
| `ExpectedSettlementDate` | `string` | Optional | Valid ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD. This is an indicative date when the payout instruction is expected to be settled to the bank. |
